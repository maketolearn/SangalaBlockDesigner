d.heading("2. What Sangala Blocks Is, and the Rule That Shapes It")
d.body("Sangala Blocks plans a kit of real LEGO bricks. A figure designed in Sangala Studio, or a mosaic "
       "made in Sangala Mosaic, is brought in as a frame, and the builder places every brick against it "
       "by hand. Because each part carries the design number it is ordered by, a finished design is also "
       "its own parts list.")
d.body("One constraint shapes every decision in the code: the application must run on a school computer "
       "with no administrator rights, no installation and no dependency fetched from the internet at run "
       "time. That is why the interface is a single HTML file, why the local program is compiled with the "
       "compiler Windows already carries, and why the renderer and the parts it needs travel inside the "
       "application's own folder rather than being installed.")
d.body("A second rule is pedagogical rather than technical: nothing is placed automatically. Choosing "
       "the parts is the work the tool exists to support.")

d.heading("6. The Browser Interface")
d.body("The page is one file: markup, style and script together, with no external library and no request "
       "to any host but the bridge. Its four regions are the menu bar, the Toolbar down the left, the "
       "workspace and the control panel; those are the names used throughout the family, and the word "
       "rail appears nowhere.")
d.body("The design is held as an array of bricks, each carrying its part, its color index, its column and "
       "row, its base, its half step, whether it is mirrored, whether it has been tipped forward and "
       "through how many quarter turns. Undo and redo work by serializing that array, and the same "
       "serialization is what a .block file holds.")
d.body("Three canvases are used: the plan view the design is built on; a second, hidden until 3D View is "
       "pressed, on which the design is drawn as layers standing off the plate; and a third, smaller, in a "
       "window over the workspace. The 3D view is a way of looking rather than a mode, and it puts the "
       "building tools aside while it is up. The window does not: the plan view stays in use behind it.")
d.body("The second and third are drawn by the SAME renderer. It takes its canvas and its camera as "
       "arguments rather than reading one set of module values, and both views are built from the one list "
       "of triangles the design produces, so the two cannot disagree about what has been built. The window "
       "redraws only when the design or the selection changes, which is tested by reducing the design to a "
       "short string and comparing it: the plan view is redrawn on every mouse move, and rebuilding tens of "
       "thousands of triangles for a pointer that moved three pixels would be the most expensive thing in "
       "the application.")
d.body("One line of the zoom arithmetic is shared with the rest of the family: SCALE100 is 2.4 CSS "
       "pixels per millimeter, under the same name and value in Sangala Studio, chosen so that 100 "
       "percent fits the working page on a typical screen and the same number typed in two windows "
       "shows the two designs at the same size. The percentage readout is an input — typing a number "
       "applies it — and Fit computes the window's own honest percentage rather than snapping to a "
       "nominal one. When the pannable world overflows the window, thin scrollbars are drawn along the "
       "workspace's bottom and right edges; they are kept in step by wrapping draw itself, and their "
       "bounds are the pan clamp's own, so the bars and the pan cannot disagree about where the world "
       "ends.")

d.heading("7. The Brick Model")
d.body("Geometry follows LEGO rather than a drawing grid. A stud is 8 mm and a plate 3.2 mm, so three "
       "plates make a brick. Bricks are drawn in side view with their studs standing proud of the top "
       "face.")

                          "vertical course counted in plates, and depth runs into the screen in studs. "
                          "See Section 8.")

                             "studs, and a part's base records how many plates it stands proud of the "
                             "backdrop.")
d.body("The control is the View selector in Settings, and it is a view rather than a kind of design: the "
       "inherent coordinates do not change, only the meaning of the vertical direction. The stored "
       "values keep their older names — standing for the side view, relief for top-down — so every file "
       "already saved opens exactly as it did. On the plan the difference is one function, vUnit, which "
       "answers 3.2 mm from the side and 8 mm top-down; the snap, the rows and the drawing all ask it. "
       "Switching the view clears the bricks placed, because the two readings of a row do not describe "
       "the same brick; the switch commits, so Ctrl-Z restores them. The stud grid draws only top-down — "
       "the grid is the plate's face — and the Grid checkbox is disabled from the side, with the reason "
       "in its tooltip.")
d.body("A brick that overlaps the plate nowhere is parked: drawn and saved, but excluded from the parts "
       "list, the 3D view and every export. That state is derived from where the brick sits rather than "

                                  "deliberately: the outline there takes a tipped part's mapping rather "
                                  "than relief's own 3D matrix, which mirrors, and which is left alone "
                                  "because changing it would alter every relief design at once.")
d.body("NOTHING FALLS. A placed part stays where it was put, whether or not a frame lies behind it. An "
       "earlier version settled each part onto whatever was under it, on the reasoning that a builder "
       "cannot stack a figure in mid-air; what that missed is that this is a plan of a model rather than "
       "the model, and a designer works out the courses in whatever order suits them. The physical rule "
       "belongs to the physical build. In a relief a part still takes its base from what is already "
       "behind it, which is not a fall but how a relief is assembled.")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- 8
d.heading("8. Depth, the Midline and the Half Step")
d.body("A standing figure is deeper than one course, and the workspace cannot show it: the plan is a side "
       "elevation — the figure in profile — so a part behind another is merely drawn behind it. Depth is therefore carried as a "
       "number and shown in a picture, never inferred from the plan.")
d.body("Depth is measured from the MIDLINE, the plane the figure is built about. A part's base records "
       "where its MOUNTING face sits, in studs, positive toward the viewer and negative away from them "
       "— for a part whose studs face the front that is its rear face, and for one tipped studs-back it "
       "is its front face; the "
       "midline is zero and carries no course of its own. Held beside it is a half step, either zero or "
       "one half, which is what places a part on the midline of a figure whose courses are a whole stud "
       "deep. The two are held apart because a placement recomputes the base and would wash a fraction "
       "straight out of it.")
d.body("Three consequences are worth stating, because each was a defect before it was a rule:", before_list=True)
d.item("Drawing Order. ", "Depth dominates, then height. Anything in front covers anything behind it "
                          "whatever their heights, and the order reverses when the figure is turned round, "
                          "or the far side would be drawn last and hide what it was turned to reveal.")
d.item("What a Part Rests On. ", "A part settles clear of where the brick below it actually is, half step "
                                 "and all, rather than clear of the layer that brick nominally occupies.")
d.item("Tipping a Part. ", "A part tipped forward is as thick as it is high and as tall as it is deep. "
                           "Its own two other dimensions are swapped onto its face, and swapped again by a "
                           "quarter turn.")
d.body("A part's base names the face it is MOUNTED BY, and which of its two faces that is depends on how "
       "it has been tipped. A part whose studs face the front is mounted by its rear face and reaches "
       "toward the viewer from there; a part whose studs face the back is mounted by its front face and "
       "reaches away. The two surfaces are therefore derived rather than assumed, by a single pair of "
       "expressions, rearB and frontB, which the plan's drawing order, its resting-place arithmetic and "
       "the paste all read. The 3D build and the LDraw export apply the same rule in their own terms: "
       "the mesh grows from the mounting face by the part's thickness, and the export offsets its "
       "placement by the part's own box. Writing that arithmetic out at each site is what allowed the "
       "three to hold three different opinions about where a studs-away part sat, each wrong by that "
       "part's own thickness or by twice it. A change to the rule must therefore be made in all three, "
       "and the three are checked against each other by rendering rather than guaranteed by "
       "construction.")
d.body("Settling belongs to PLACEMENT and to nothing else. A part being put down for the first time comes "
       "to rest clear of whatever occupies its columns, measured from the side the builder is standing "
       "on. A part already in the design has a depth its designer chose, so moving it across the plan "
       "leaves that depth alone — including a move out to the cork and back, which is how a part is "
       "lifted aside to reach the one beneath it.")
d.body("The builder moves a part through this axis with the Depth control in the panel, whose two arrows "
       "step it half a layer at a time. Where a step lands is split back into the whole layer the part is "
       "in and the half it stands off, so a part can be carried through any number of layers by repeating "
       "the step.")
d.body("Whether a layer should also be NUMBERED for the builder, and what such a number would count, is "
       "not settled. The panel shows no layer number today: the window over the workspace shows where a "
       "part sits among its neighbours, which is what a number was being asked to say in words.")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- 9
d.heading("9. Copy and Paste")
d.body("Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V are Sangala Studio's, function for function, because Studio settled the question "
       "first: a copy carries everything about the part, repeated pastes fan out rather than stack, the "
       "new copy becomes the selection, and each paste commits at once so a run of them undoes one at a "
       "time. What differs is the step. A brick lives on the stud grid, so a copy moves one STUD along as "
       "seen, which is a column lower once the builder has walked round to the far side.")
d.body("The clipboard holds the BRICK, not a reading taken from it. While the original is still in the "
       "design a paste reads its current column, row and layer; only a brick deleted since the copy falls "
       "back to the recorded snapshot. A snapshot alone was wrong for the way the application is used: a "
       "part is dragged aside to reach the one beneath it and copied where it has been dragged to, where "
       "it is mounted on nothing, and both its position and its depth were then taken from the staging "
       "area rather than from the figure.")
d.body("A copy of a part lying on the side away from the builder is brought round to the side the "
       "builder is standing on — which is the far side reached through Front / Back, and equally a "
       "far-side part copied while facing the front. The rule for where it lands took three attempts:",
       before_list=True)
d.item("Not the Midline. ", "Reflecting the part's span about the midline is right only where the body it "

                            "layers in front of the midline sends a plate mounted on it two layers behind "
                            "the figure, hanging in space.")
d.item("Not Settled. ", "Asking where the part would COME TO REST from the far side is symmetric and still "
                        "wrong, because it settles clear of everything in those columns. A wing eight "
                        "layers away in the same columns takes the copy with it.")
d.item("Its Own Host. ", "The copy is reflected about the mid-plane of the brick the original is mounted "
                         "on, following that chain through tipped detail to the body brick beneath it, so "
                         "a plate on a side-stud brick's front face lands on its back face. A part mounted "
                         "on nothing has no such brick, and the midline is then the only mirror there is.")
d.body("Neither side settles, which is what makes the two behave alike: a copy on the near side is an "
       "exact twin one stud along, and a copy on the far side is that twin's mirror image — and, if the "
       "original was itself tipped, tipped the other way so its studs face the builder. An upright brick "
       "is mirrored and left upright. All of this belongs to a standing figure: a relief has one side "
       "and nothing in it is tipped, so a paste there is always the plain twin. The mirror excludes the "
       "copies a run of pastes has already put down, or a "
       "body brick pasted twice would mirror about its own first copy and march backward through the "
       "figure a course at a time.")

d.heading("10. The Frame")
d.body("The frame is held twice, and the doubling is the design. guideRaw is the unscaled geometry — "
       "what a .block file stores — and guide is the working copy, derived from it by the Frame scale "
       "whenever it is needed and never stored, so a restored or reopened design cannot end up scaled "
       "twice. Every edit writes both in step: the drag applies one delta to the working copy and the "
       "same delta over the scale to the raw one, and the resize applies the same factors about the "
       "same anchor in each space.")
d.body("Placement is remembered rather than baked in. placeX and placeY hold where the design sits on "
       "the plate, and draw lays the stud lattice, the frame and the bricks down together at that "
       "offset — one placement over everything that lives in design coordinates, which is what keeps a "
       "brick's studs on the outline it was placed against. Baking the offset into the frame's points "
       "instead once put the frame and the bricks on lattices 4.7 mm apart, which no snapping could "
       "cure.")
d.body("A frame arrives two ways. A .model is read the way Sangala Studio would place it — each "
       "polygon at its own coordinates times the design's scale, offset by its saved position — with a "
       "region's thickness and lift converted from millimeters to plates. A .mosaic is read by Studio's "
       "own importer carried over: the built grid of tiles, each named mass traced into one region "
       "under its name, and tiles in no mass traced one region per same-color patch so the picture "
       "survives. Two rules guard the mosaic path. The backdrop of a photograph — the field of tiles "
       "reachable from the built rectangle's corners in the corner's own color — is left behind, and "
       "that flood runs only when every cell of the rectangle carries a tile, the signature of a "
       "photograph's build; a sparse mosaic already cleaned by hand is not touched, a gate added after "
       "the flood ate the grass out of exactly such a file. And a tile's height follows the view: one "
       "stud wide by two plates tall from the side, so every edge of the frame lands on a line a brick "
       "can land on — 8 mm is 2.5 plates, so square tiles can never be plate-true — and a stud square "
       "top-down. The page is switched to the baseplate, which is the surface a mosaic is built on.")
d.body("The frame answers Studio's selection grammar. Clicking selects the topmost region under the "
       "point — the last drawn, which is how the eye reads it — Shift adds to the set, and the sweep "
       "takes what lies fully inside, bricks and frame elements in the same gesture. A drag re-derives "
       "every position from copies taken at the press plus one total delta, so a snap engaging and "
       "letting go leaves no accumulated drift; the set's minimum corner snaps to the stud-and-plate "
       "lattice absolutely, Studio's rule, with Alt dragging free and the magnet in the zoom cluster "
       "as the switch. The palette follows a selected element's fill and a palette choice recolors it. "
       "Bricks rest against the frame's indexed top, so the index is rebuilt when a drag or a resize "
       "ends.")
d.body("The resize box is Studio's, carried over line for line: eight square handles on the selection's "
       "bounding box, a corner scaling uniformly by projecting the pointer onto the original diagonal "
       "so drifting off it does not wobble the scale, a mid-edge handle scaling one axis about the "
       "opposite side, and the scale floored short of zero so a handle dragged through its anchor "
       "cannot silently mirror the frame. Sizes are reported in studs and plates as the handle moves.")
d.body("Transparent draws the bricks translucent so the frame reads through them — Mosaic's tracing "
       "view with the pair reversed. The alpha is owned by the brick-drawing function itself, whose "
       "first act is to set it; an earlier attempt to set it around the brick pass was stomped brick "
       "by brick, which is worth remembering before adding any translucency elsewhere. The brick's "
       "shadow fades with its brick; the hover ghost and the selection marks keep full strength. The "
       "mode and the slider are view state, saved in no file; the frame itself — raw geometry, scale "
       "and placement — travels in the .block.")

d.heading("11. Groups, Names and the Parts List")
d.body("A group binds bricks so that they select and move as one. The objects stay separate and can be "
       "taken apart again: grouping is a bundle, not a weld.")
d.body("Grouping nests. Each brick carries gpath, the path of group numbers it belongs to, outermost "
       "first, and group is simply the first of them. Group puts a new number on the front of that path, "
       "so a group can sit inside a group, and Ungroup removes the first one — peeling one level "
       "and leaving anything inside it standing.")
d.body("A name belongs to a level, not to a brick, so gnames runs parallel to gpath and gnames[0] is the "
       "outermost group's name. Held as a single field it could only ever carry one name, and naming an "
       "outer group wrote over the name an inner group already had. The name is written on every member "
       "rather than into a table of groups, which is Sangala Studio's arrangement exactly: an attribute "
       "travels with the brick through every copy, save and undo, with no second structure to keep in "
       "step.")
d.body("The parts list buckets by the outermost name. A part used in two groups therefore appears twice, "
       "once under each name, each row counting only that group's pieces — which is what makes a row "
       "unambiguous enough to drag. The bucketed form is also what the by-element Word document and the "
       "kit file are written from. The plain tally the .txt list and the BrickLink order are built from "
       "is not bucketed: those need one line per part and color across the whole design, since the same "
       "brick used in a head and in a wing is one thing to buy.")
d.body("Two pieces of state sit behind the list, and they are deliberately different in kind:", before_list=True)
d.item("The Arrangement Is the Design's. ", "A list of names is written into the .block file, carried in "
       "the undo snapshot, and updated when a group is renamed. It is keyed by name rather than by "
       "position, so building another group cannot silently reorder the rest, and a group re-created with "
       "a name the file already knows returns to its place.")
d.item("The Fold Is the Panel's. ", "Which sections are folded away is held in the page alone and is not "
       "saved. A folded section is still in the design, in the parts list and in the order.")
d.body("Joining and leaving are the same two acts the buttons perform, reached by dragging a row. A row "
       "under Other Parts dropped on a named section takes that group's number and name at the front of "
       "its own path — which is what Group does, except that the number already exists, and that is "
       "the whole of the difference between joining a group and making one. A row under a name dropped "
       "into Other Parts is Ungroup's one-level peel. Other Parts is kept on the list once any group "
       "exists, even when empty, because joining the last loose part would otherwise remove the only "
       "place a part can be dropped to leave a group.")
d.body("The names matter beyond this application. Sangala Studio reads a .block file, and every named "
       "group arrives there as an element that can be given a depth and printed as one piece. What is "
       "named here decides what can be worked with as a piece there.")

d.heading("12. The Parts Catalog")
d.body("Every part the application offers carries a real design number and a real footprint, and both are "
       "read from the LDraw library rather than typed. Two tools do that reading: tools/ldparts.py "
       "resolves a number, reports the part's own description and measures its geometry, and "
       "tools/sizes_from_ldraw.py generates the table of sizes the menu offers.")
d.body("Three facts about the library shape that code. A part's first line is its description, so a "
       "number needs no index to be named. A superseded number answers with a redirection, which must be "
       "followed to reach the geometry. And the measurements are exact: one LDraw unit is 0.4 mm, a stud "
       "is 20 units, a plate 8 and a brick 24, with the Y axis pointing down so that a part's origin sits "
       "at the top of its body.")
d.body("A size that no real part has is reported as such. A parts list that claims a part which cannot be "
       "bought is worse than no parts list.")
d.body("The palette is bound to the selection in both directions. Selecting a brick moves the palette to "
       "its color, and a color chosen while a brick is selected is written onto that brick and "
       "committed, so it undoes as one step and the parts list is rebuilt — the list groups by part AND "
       "color, so a recolor moves a piece from one row to another. With no brick selected the palette is "
       "only the color the next placement will take. The rule that a color chosen while a LIBRARY row is "
       "selected stays with that part number is unchanged and independent: one records what the builder "
       "means a part to be, the other repaints a brick already placed.")
d.body("A library is written as well as read. The Save menu writes what the panel holds, merged, as a "
       ".library file; the extension is the word a student meets at both ends, and the marker inside "
       "says the same. Either marker opens, so every .parts file already made is unaffected - the "
       "format did not change, only what it is called.")
d.body("A library STATES neither color nor quantity. It is a catalog of shapes: what a part is, not "
       "what it is to be made in or how many are owned. Color is chosen from the palette at the moment a "
       "brick is placed and then stays with that part number, so a body brick set to green is placed in "
       "green until it is changed; and a quantity belongs to the parts list, which counts what the design "
       "actually uses and is what a physical build is ordered from. An entry that names a color would be "
       "a choice made on the builder's behalf, and one that names a quantity invites the panel to be read "
       "as stock. The format has not changed: an older file that carries a color still seeds the palette "
       "when its row is picked, and a quantity in one is simply not shown, so nothing already written is "
       "stranded.")
d.body("A .parts library extends that catalog at run time. tools/parts_library.py turns a submitted list "
       "of numbers into one, deriving every field from LDraw but the two a submitted line may name — a "
       "color and a quantity, which are copied through and which the application no longer reads. The "
       "page merges it "
       "into the menu, adding sizes it did not have and whole kinds it did not know. Two consequences "
       "follow. A library may name a part the page's own tables never held, so tools/bundle_parts.py "
       "reads every library in the repository as well as the page — a part that can be placed but was not "
       "shipped renders as nothing at all, with no error. And a design records the libraries it was built "
       "from, so opening it elsewhere reports what is missing rather than quietly offering less.")

       "subsystem. Walking every part number the page can place, through its redirections and its "
       "sub-file references, yields 62 files out of the library's 24,591 — a pruning worth making. That "
       "walk does not find what LDView substitutes as it draws: the logo-bearing stud that puts the "
       "manufacturer's name on every stud top, and the 48-segment versions of the curves. Nothing refers "
       "to those files, and their absence raises no error; it renders a picture that looks correct and "
       "differs from the full library by thousands of pixels, every one of them on a stud.")
d.body("All 2,833 primitives are therefore shipped, at a cost of 9.6 MB. tools/bundle_parts.py computes "

       "height, shape and the studs on its faces, so a kit opens complete on any machine with no library "
       "beside it. Opened, it arrives as its own panel beside the design; it is session state and is "
       "never written into the .block. The one thing in the BrickLink file which cannot be derived is the color. BrickLink "
       "numbers colors its own way and the numbers do not agree with LDraw — red is 4 to LDraw and 5 to "
       "BrickLink — and no rule converts between them, so each is recorded in the palette beside the LDraw "
       "code, read from BrickLink's own guide. A color with no BrickLink number is left out of the export "
